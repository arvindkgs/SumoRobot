Mini-sumo is a competition between robots based on Japanese wrestling –
“sumo” is the Japanese word for wrestling. Similar to traditional sumo matches,
two opponents (robots) face each other in a ring named a dohyo – see below figure.
The object is to stay in the ring while pushing the opposing robot out of the ring.
The robot that stays in the ring the longest wins the match.

Theory of Operation
* stay on the dohyo 
* hunt for the opponent 
* target (aim at) the opponent
* attack the opponent
